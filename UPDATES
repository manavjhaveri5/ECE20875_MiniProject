Manav 17th April

Filtered the data to only contain users which have completed 5 videos

Created poin, gmm, clusters to implement kmeans

Gmm calculated optimum number of clusters as 3 when provided a range from 1 to 6, took like 20 seconds to output that value so im guessing giving it a larger range will make the time much longer

Dont need individual, clusters class, can just directly use scikit for kmeans but I just made it for now
Need to recheck the visualization and cluster formation, and make sense of it for analysis
